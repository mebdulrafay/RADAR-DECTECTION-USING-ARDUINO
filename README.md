# RADAR-DECTECTION-USING-ARDUINO
This radar project includes an **AI-based voice feedback system**.

- When an object is detected, the system generates **AI voice alerts** instead of simple beeps.
- The AI voice announces distance and object presence in real time.
- This makes the radar more interactive, smart, and user-friendly.

### How It Works
1. Ultrasonic sensor detects the object and calculates distance.
2. Arduino sends data through Serial communication.
3. AI voice system converts the data into **human-like speech**.
4. Voice alerts inform the user about object distance and position.

### Example Voice Alerts
- "Object detected"
- "Object is very close"
- "Distance is 25 centimeters"
- "Warning! Obstacle ahead"

### Benefits
- Better understanding without looking at screen
- More advanced than buzzer-based alerts
- Useful for smart security and assistive technology
## 🔧 Additional Requirements
- AI Text-to-Speech (TTS) system
- PC / Mobile / AI module for voice generation
- Serial communication with Arduino
## ✨ Highlight
Unlike traditional radar projects, this system uses **AI voice feedback** to provide smart, real-time audio information.
